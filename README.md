# Student-Data-Scientists:
Student Data Scientists has been created to fill in the gap of learning between traditional course work and what comes after graduation. 
Join our team and learn to solve real data issues while working with peers and mentors.

# First code-R-thon Project Information: 
PLEASE READ The "PCHH â€“ Data Project Summary.pptx" file in the PCHH folder.
This power point explains the project problems and goals.

The rest of the files listed will be used to help build the new dataframe in R.  
Taking time before the event to browse through these documents will increase the speed at which we can work together as a team. 

# First Steps:
The EMR is a postgres SQL relational database.  We will be using Rpostgres to connect to the database and build a dataframe with the required outcome measures. 

# Packages required to run code for the event:
sqldf
